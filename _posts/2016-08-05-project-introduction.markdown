## Overview
---

Hand Map is the title I've given the project I'm currently in the process of implementing for my final year Computer Systems and Networking project with Curtin University.

The goal is to create an accessible way for people living with cerebral palsy to generate their own splint sketch files that could be 3D printed; saving them regular trips to specialised medical centers.

## Requirements
---

The requirements for this project will be fairly dynamic, as the expected deliverable's will change depending on how smoothly the early stages of the project go.

Current requirement are as follows:

 * Hand Detection
 * Object Detection
 * Hand Mapping based on Object's position on Hand
 * 3D Restructure of Hand model from 2D Images

## Special Thanks
