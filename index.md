# About Hand Map

Hand Map is a project currently in the research phase by Nathan Glover of Curtin University.

You can bookmark this site to follow the design and implementation process carried out as we work towards 3D hand modeling using 2D camera techniques.

The goal is to create an accessible way for people living with cerebral palsy to generate their own splint sketch files that could be 3D printed; saving them regular trips to specialised medical centers.
