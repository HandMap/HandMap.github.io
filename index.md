# About Hand Map

Hand Map is a project currently in the research phase by Nathan Glover of Curtin University.

You can bookmark this site to follow the design and implementation process carried out as we work towards 3D hand modelling using 2D camera techniques.

The goal is to create an accessible way for people living with cerebral palsy to generate their own splint sketch files that could be 3D printed; saving them regular trips to specialised medical centres.

### Active Issues

Some of the current implementation issues I am facing are summarized below. If you have any information that might be useful to my research I encourage you to flick me an email on <a href="mailto:nathan@glovers.id.au">nathan@glovers.id.au</a>

<dl>
  <dd>In respect to GestureApi, I am working on a solution to better analyse hands that aren't in typical shapes (CP Flexion).</dd>
  <dd>In respect to GestureApi, I am working to ensure hand detection can occur in lighting environments.</dd>
  <dd>In respect to GestureApi, I am working to port the API to Python3 in my spare time. Not overly important but It would be nice to help update the code for others.</dd>
